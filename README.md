There are three types of climate cycle: The first one is similar to the vanilla Climate Cycle, only it ramps up quicker and further. The second version is a climate cycle that gets hotter and hotter and the final version gets colder and colder. You can change these in the Settings menu.

It also adds an alert for Heatstroke. You'll need it.
